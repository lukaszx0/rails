module Rails
  # Rails::Engine allows you to wrap a specific Rails application and share it accross
  # different applications. Since Rails 3.0, every Rails::Application is nothing
  # more than an Engine, allowing you to share it very easily.
  #
  # Any Rails::Engine is also a Rails::Railtie, so the same methods (like rake_tasks and
  # generators) and configuration available in the latter can also be used in the former.
  #
  # == Creating an Engine
  #
  # In Rails versions before to 3.0, your gems automatically behaved as Engine, however
  # this coupled Rails to Rubygems. Since Rails 3.0, if you want a gem to automatically
  # behave as Engine, you have to specify an Engine for it somewhere inside your plugin
  # lib folder (similar with how we spceify a Railtie):
  #
  #   # lib/my_engine.rb
  #   module MyEngine
  #     class Engine < Rails::Engine
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Then ensure that this file is loaded at the top of your config/application.rb (or in
  # your Gemfile) and it will automatically load models, controllers and helpers
  # inside app, load routes at "config/routes.rb", load locales at "config/locales/*",
  # load tasks at "lib/tasks/*".
  #
  # == Configuration
  #
  # Besides the Railtie configuration which is shared across the application, in a
  # Rails::Engine you can access autoload_paths, eager_load_paths and autoload_once_paths,
  # which differently from a Railtie, are scoped to the current Engine.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
  #     # Add a load path for this specific Engine
  #     config.autoload_paths << File.expand_path("../lib/some/path", __FILE__)
  #
  #     initializer "my_engine.add_middleware" do |app|
  #       app.middleware.use MyEngine::Middleware
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Paths
  #
  # Since Rails 3.0, both your Application and Engines do not have hardcoded paths.
  # This means that you are not required to place your controllers at "app/controllers",
  # but in any place which you find convenient.
  #
  # For example, let's suppose you want to lay your controllers at lib/controllers, all
  # you need to do is:
  #
  #   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
  #     paths.app.controllers = "lib/controllers"
  #   end
  #
  # You can also have your controllers being loaded from both "app/controllers" and
  # "lib/controllers":
  #
  #   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
  #     paths.app.controllers << "lib/controllers"
  #   end
  #
  # The available paths in an Engine are:
  #
  #   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
  #     paths.app                 = "app"
  #     paths.app.controllers     = "app/controllers"
  #     paths.app.helpers         = "app/helpers"
  #     paths.app.models          = "app/models"
  #     paths.app.views           = "app/views"
  #     paths.lib                 = "lib"
  #     paths.lib.tasks           = "lib/tasks"
  #     paths.config              = "config"
  #     paths.config.initializers = "config/initializers"
  #     paths.config.locales      = "config/locales"
  #     paths.config.routes       = "config/routes.rb"
  #   end
  #
  # Your Application class adds a couple more paths to this set. And as in your Application,
  # all folders under "app" are automatically added to the load path. So if you have
  # "app/observers", it's added by default.
  #
  # == Endpoint
  #
  # Engine can be also a rack application. It can be useful if you have a rack application that
  # you would like to wrap with Engine and provide some of the Engine's features.
  #
  # To do that, use endpoint method:
  #   module MyEngine
  #     class Engine < Rails::Engine
  #       endpoint MyRackApplication
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Now you can mount your engine in application's routes just like that:
  #
  # MyRailsApp::Application.routes.draw do
  #   mount MyEngine::Engine => "/engine"
  # end
  #
  # == Middleware stack
  #
  # As Engine can now be rack endpoint, it can also have a middleware stack. The usage is exactly
  # the same as in application:
  #
  #   module MyEngine
  #     class Engine < Rails::Engine
  #       middleware.use SomeMiddleware
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Routes
  #
  # If you don't specify endpoint, routes will be used as default endpoint. You can use them
  # just like you use application's routes:
  #
  # # ENGINE/config/routes.rb
  # MyEngine::Engine.routes.draw do
  #   match "/" => "posts#index"
  # end
  #
  # == Mount priority
  #
  # Note that now there can be more than one router in you application and it's better to avoid
  # passing requests through many routers. Consider such situation:
  #
  # MyRailsApp::Application.routes.draw do
  #   mount MyEngine::Engine => "/blog"
  #   match "/blog/omg" => "main#omg"
  # end
  #
  # MyEngine is mounted at "/blog" path and additionaly "/blog/omg" points application's controller.
  # In such situation request to "/blog/omg" will go through MyEngine and if there is no such route
  # in Engine's routes, it will be dispatched to "main#omg". It's much better to swap that:
  #
  # MyRailsApp::Application.routes.draw do
  #   match "/blog/omg" => "main#omg"
  #   mount MyEngine::Engine => "/blog"
  # end
  #
  # Now, Engine will get only requests that were not handled by application.
  #
  # == Asset path
  #
  # When you use engine with its own public directory, you will probably want to copy or symlink it
  # to application's public directory. To simplify generating paths for assets, you can set asset_path
  # for an Engine:
  #
  # module MyEngine
  #   class Engine < Rails::Engine
  #     config.asset_path = "/my_engine/%s"
  #   end
  # end
  #
  # With such config, asset paths will be automatically modified inside Engine:
  # image_path("foo.jpg") #=> "/my_engine/images/foo.jpg"
  #
  # == Namespaced Engine
  #
  # Normally, when you create controllers, helpers and models inside engine, they are treated
  # as they would be created inside application. One of the cosequences of that is including
  # application's helpers and url_helpers inside controller. Sometimes, especially when your
  # engine provides its own routes, you don't want that. To isolate engine's stuff from application
  # you can use namespace method:
  #
  # module MyEngine
  #   class Engine < Rails::Engine
  #     namespace MyEngine
  #   end
  # end
  #
  # With such Engine, everything that is inside MyEngine module, will be isolated from application.
  #
  # Consider such controller:
  #
  # module MyEngine
  #   class FooController < ActionController::Base
  #   end
  # end
  #
  # If engine is marked as namespaced, FooController has access only to helpers from engine and
  # url_helpers from MyEngine::Engine.routes.
  #
  # Additionaly namespaced engine will set its name according to namespace, so in that case:
  # MyEngine::Engine.engine_name #=> "my_engine"
  # and it will set MyEngine.table_name_prefix to "my_engine_"
  #
  class Engine < Railtie
